# -Python
Hi! This is an example of my data analysis project using Python. I worked on it during my Data Science course at my university.

Here I analyzed what type of startups tend to fail their crowdfunding and what startup type tend to be more successful.
I downloaded the data from Kaggle.com, cleaned it, and analyzed it. Then, I came up with some data conclusions and visualization.

File "finalProjectDriver" is where you can find my Main method. 
File "finalProjectFunctions" is where all the functions for my Main method are stored.
